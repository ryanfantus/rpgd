This Internet server is dedicated to run this fine Role-Playing Game.
Its main theme and purpose is to provide a fantasy, medieval setting for
the players (YOU) to interact with one another in fights, jousts, brawls,
and other explorations.  While the action here can get hot, this game
provides an excellent source of playful recreation.

The object of this game is to ascend in experience levels until reaching
level 100.  There, you become immortal and have a chance to become a
powerful Paladin, Titan, or God-character.  The first player to roll as a
God-class wins the game and the board is reset.

You begin as a Novice class adventurer and your assigned ability points  
define your capabilities.  A good place to begin your quest is in the
Arena where you can joust another user.  If successful, you can win money
from the contest to buy items from the Town Square.  The rest is up to you 
to explore on your own.

Happy Hunting!
