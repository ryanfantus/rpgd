A Rogue is similar to a Thief class with a backstab, poison, and stealing.
But, their advantage lies in their effective use of magic scrolls.  While
Rogues get only the usual +1 in all abilities per experience level, they can
achieve better than average abilities across the board.

Melee:     Average
Backstab:  Average
Poison:    Average
Magic:     Scrolls
Stealing:  Good
