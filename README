1.  ./autogen.sh
    ./configure
    make
    make install

2.  Make certain you have the file, rpgd.conf, in the directory /etc.  There
    is a sample rpgd.conf in the rpgd/etc that has in it:

HOME=/usr/local/rpgd
GROUP=nobody
USER=nobody
#DEV=/dev/ttyS1
#ROWS=4
#COLS=20

HOME, GROUP, and USER are required for rpgd to run.  rpgd must run as 'root',
but will change its current work directory to HOME, and its user and group id
to whatever is specified (nobody).

DEV, ROWS, and COLS are optional parameters to use to dump user logoff 
statistics to, i.e., to a serial video display in your server.  The # is
used to comment out this feature.

3.  Make certain rpgd is running.  It should install a line in your server's
    /etc/inittab, like the following:

# Run rpgd
rpgd:35:respawn:/usr/local/bin/rpgd -d

You might have to issue a 'telinit q' at the root console prompt to inform
init that its configuration file has been changed and needs to be re-read.

    For init hosts, copy init/rpgd.conf to /etc/init

    For systemd hosts, copy etc/rpgd.service to
    /etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants

Check for rpgd by typing:

ps auxw | grep rpg

You can check its log:

cat log/rpgd.log

It should start with:
rpgd v2.5.7

4.  Run the rpgclient program or use the 'hack' convenience script.
    If you get a 'connection refused' error message, that means rpgd is NOT
    running.

5.  Connecting remotely with the Windows RPGCLIENT.exe program.  By default,
    rpgclient is on port #7000 and is inserted in your /etc/services file:

grep rpg /etc/services

rpgclient       7000/tcp                        # RPGclient

If that line is not in there, you cannot connect remotely.

By default, an /etc/xinetd.d/rpgclient service script is created:

cat /etc/xinetd.d/rpgclient

# default: off
# description: The RPGD client allows remote users to login to play
#              Hack & Slash.
service rpgclient
{
        disable = no
        socket_type             = stream
        wait                    = no
        user                    = root
        server                  = /usr/local/bin/rpgclient
        log_on_success          += USERID
        log_on_failure          += USERID
}

You might have to restart the xinetd service, such as:

service xinetd restart

6.  Make certain your firewall allows port #7000 to come in.

7.  Make certain that the rpgd binaries are installed in a directory that is
    part of the root's path, i.e., /usr/local/bin

echo $PATH

/usr/kerberos/sbin:/usr/kerberos/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/X11R6/bin:/usr/local/j2sdk1.4.1/bin:/usr/local/Sophos/bin:/root/bin


Happy Hunting!
